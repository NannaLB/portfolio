  <h3>About the project:</h3>
  <p> As a schoolproject we were asked to make an online version of our portfolio, build from scratch with HTML and CSS. It had to be with a flawless coding and a structure of files, documented in GitHub. </p>
  <h3>Category:</h3>
  <p>Website</p>
  <h3>The result:</h3>
  <p>I began the project by sketching the kind of web structure I needed to match my portfolio prototype.
    When I thought the skeleton was in order, I started coding the web layout with HTML in Dreamweaver and pasted the content I wanted to present. When all of the content was in place, I started styling the website with CSS. During the process I realized, that I had made it too difficult for myself to navigate in the different codes not having been thorough enough with my skeleton of the structure. I quickly learned that every detail of content has to be thought through, placing it in the correct structure from the beginning of the project in order to reach the layout I wanted.
    This have been a great learning process, and the next time I am to build a website, it will change my approach to the project as it will make me able to be more efficient and reach the layout result I want. </p>

  <h3>About the project:</h3>
  <p> As a schoolproject, we were asked to 
    make an app, and present it in Adobe XD for both mobile devices and tablets. We should also create our own icons in Adobe Illustrator, and write a report about the proces of the project. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Category:</h3>
  <p>Adobe XD, App Design, Photoshop, Illustrator, Proces</p>
  <br>
  <h3>The result:</h3>
  <p>I chose to make a weather app that is supposed to be easily readable, and with the purpose of being easy to access. I wanted a weather app that could be customized the individual user, being able to show the weather forecast in a specific route, chosen by the user and sending rain- and wind alerts in a given period of time. After sending out questionnaires and targeting the audience, it became clear, that there was a market for this type of weather app. I made a sketch in hand, drawing the structure and setup I wanted, and made several user tests, and a flowchart to make the app as logical and user friendly as possible. 
    I then began drawing the icons in Illustrator with the thought in mind, that the app should be minimalistic and distinct.
    When everything was set I began the work in Adobe XD, making a prototype for both mobile devices and tablets. </p>

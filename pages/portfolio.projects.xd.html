  <h3>About the project:</h3>
  <p>As a schoolproject, we were asked 
    to make our portfolio as
    a website protptype.</p>
  <h3>Category:</h3>
  <p>Adobe XD, Photoshop</p>
  <h3>The result:</h3>
  <p>I started by drawing a sketch on paper,
    trying to make the website design
    as i wanted it to appear.
    Afterwards i made a collage in
    Photoshop, to set the visual direction
    for my portfolio project.
    I decided that i want a logo on the 
    top left side, as a home- and 
    menu-button, but i am still working on 
    this. So for now, the button comes 
    without logo. Then I started working on the navigation, to make sure that the site would be easy to figure out. This ended up in a functional XD prototype. </p>

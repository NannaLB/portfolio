  <h3>About the project:</h3>
  <p> As a schoolproject, we were asked to 
    take pictures of bridges in Copenhagen, 
    and work on it in PSD, and place an object that wasn't there in the beginning. </p>
  <br>
	<h3>Category:</h3>
  <p>Photography, Photoshop</p>
  <br>
	<h3>The result:</h3>
  <p>I took various pictures of bridges, 
    trying to capture the right one.
    When i decided which picture to use,
    i started the work in photoshop. 
    The picture was quite dark, so i 
    regulated it with lights, hue and 
    saturation. Afterwards i removed the 
    garbagecan, and inserted a ferry, 
    making the water look as natural 
    as possible around it. </p>
